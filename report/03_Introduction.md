# Introduction

Quantum machine learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, where quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and interference are harnessed to enhance computational capabilities for learning tasks. As quantum hardware continues to mature from experimental prototypes to commercially accessible systems, understanding the fundamental principles that enable quantum algorithms to process classical data becomes increasingly critical for researchers and practitioners alike.

This project implements and experimentally validates the interference-based squared-distance classifier introduced by Schuld and Petruccione in Chapter 1.2 of their seminal textbook on quantum machine learning. This algorithm serves as an elegant pedagogical example that demonstrates how quantum interference—a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon—can be leveraged for supervised binary classification. Unlike complex variational quantum algorithms that require extensive parameterization and optimization, this approach utilizes a remarkably simple 4-qubit circuit with a single Hadamard gate, making it an ideal entry point for understanding quantum approaches to machine learning.

The algorithm encodes classical feature vectors into quantum amplitudes through a process known as amplitude encoding, where normalized data points are embedded into the probability amplitudes of a quantum state. By duplicating the test sample with both possible class labels and applying a Hadamard gate to an ancilla qubit, the circuit creates quantum superposition states that, after post-selection, produce measurement probabilities proportional to squared Euclidean distances between the test point and training exemplars. This quantum interference mechanism effectively implements a distance-based classifier without explicitly computing distance metrics—showcasing the potential elegance of quantum information processing.

To validate this theoretical framework, we implement the complete pipeline using the Qiskit quantum computing framework and execute the circuit on two platforms: the ideal Qiskit Aer simulator and real IBM Quantum hardware (ibm_fez backend with 156 qubits). The implementation uses a toy Titanic survival dataset with three passengers, maintaining complete fidelity to the textbook example to enable direct comparison with expected theoretical outcomes. This dual-platform execution strategy reveals critical insights into both the algorithm's theoretical soundness and its practical limitations when confronted with hardware noise, gate imperfections, and decoherence.

Beyond merely reproducing textbook results, this work provides comprehensive analysis of quantum-classical hybridization challenges, post-selection overhead implications (approximately 50% sample loss), and hardware noise impact quantification. The findings underscore that while this particular algorithm offers no quantum computational advantage—being classically simulable due to its Clifford-only gate set—it nevertheless provides invaluable pedagogical insights into how quantum resources might be exploited for machine learning tasks, establishing foundational understanding necessary for exploring more sophisticated quantum learning algorithms.
